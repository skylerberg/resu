PyRes
=====

PyRes converts YAML files into other formats based on templates. The use case 
that PyRes is built for is resume generation. However, PyRes should be generic
enough for other uses.

Changes
=======

Since I hosting this on GitHub from the start, there will be a lot of commits
before release 0.0.0. After the first release I will use semantic versioning.
