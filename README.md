Resu
====

Resu is currently undergoing major changes. After implementing a CLI
application that transformed plain text files into PDFs, I have identified
many areas of improvement that I can make in the design. For this second
implementation, I will be creating resu as a django project. Old code will be
left for now. The new will be placed in the "server" and "client" folders.


Documentation
=============

NOTE: Documentation does not yet reflect the change to a django application.
To see how to install and use Resu, please read the [documentation](https://resu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).
