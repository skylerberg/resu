Contributing
============

One of the most useful and easiest ways to contribute is to give feedback. Any
feature ideas, bug reports, or suggestions can be posted as `issues on GitHub 
<https://github.com/skylerberg/resu/issues>`_. To contribute code, fork the 
`repository <https://github.com/skylerberg/resu>`_, make commit your changes
and issue pull a pull request. Every issue or pull request will receive a 
response from someone with commit access on Resu.
